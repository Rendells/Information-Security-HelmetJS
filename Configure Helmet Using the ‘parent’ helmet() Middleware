As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on Gitpod, or cloned from GitHub.

app.use(helmet()) will automatically include all the middleware introduced above, except noCache(), and contentSecurityPolicy(), but these can be enabled if necessary. You can also disable or configure any other middleware individually, using a configuration object.

Example:

app.use(helmet({
  frameguard: {         // configure
    action: 'deny'
  },
  contentSecurityPolicy: {    // enable and configure
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ['style.com'],
    }
  },
  dnsPrefetchControl: false     // disable
}))
We introduced each middleware separately for teaching purposes and for ease of testing. Using the ‘parent’ helmet() middleware is easy to implement in a real project.
